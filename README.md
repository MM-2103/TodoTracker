## Features

- Add, update, and delete todos
- Categorize todos (work, personal, shopping, other)
- Set priority levels (high, medium, low)
- Basic sentiment analysis of todo titles

## Technologies Used

- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Replit AI

## How to Serve the App

1.  **Start the Server:** Navigate to the server directory and run the appropriate command to start the server. This might be `npm run dev`, `yarn dev`, `node server.js`, or similar, depending on your server setup.  Refer to the server's `README` or documentation for the specific command.

    ```bash
    cd server
    npm run dev # or yarn dev, node server.js, etc.
    ```

2.  **Start the Client:** In a separate terminal, navigate to the client directory and start the client application. This usually involves a command like `npm start`, `yarn start`, or `npm run dev`.  Again, consult the client's `README` for the correct command.

    ```bash
    cd client
    npm start # or yarn start, npm run dev, etc.
    ```

3.  **Access the App:** Once both the server and client are running, open your web browser and navigate to the address where the client application is served (typically `http://localhost:3000` or similar).
